\section{Monte Carlo method}
Monte Carlo method is used on the same problem as before. It uses random numbers and a uniform probability distribution. It gives the result \tabref{tab:BFM}. Where the Integral value is close to but not exactly the same as the closed form solution. Also it looks like there is something not working correctly with the standard deviation, it gives values that are to small, when comparing the result with the closed form solution.

Number of integration points & Integral value & standard deviation \\
\hline

$10^8$ & 0.175551  & 0.000126166 \\
