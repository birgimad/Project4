\subsection{Test of one Spin Flip for $2\times 2$ Case}
\label{Test2times2OneFlip}
A simple test is made on the algorithm by considering a $2\times 2$ lattice having four spin values which forms the four elements of a 2 by 2 matrix. 
Here we calculated how the energy and magnetization of the lattice changes with one spin flip. 
The matrix elements are chosen to be $a_{11} = 1$, $a_{12} = -1$, $a_{21} = 1$, $a_{22} = 1$. 
The spin at the position $a_{12} = -1$ is selected and energy of the initial configuration is calculated by multiplying spin value at $a_{12}$ with the neighbouring spin values and adding them that gave a result of 0. 
The calculated energy is tested to be less than or equal to zero or not. 
If it is the configuration is accepted and the energy and magnetization  is updated and the configuration is changed by flipping one spin only and if its not then the value $w = exp(-\Delta E/T)$ is calculated and the probability $w$ is compared with a random number $r$ uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. 
If $w > r$ the configuration is accepted and the energy and magnetization is updated and the configuration is changed by flipping the spin. 
In the present case since the calculated energy of the present state is equal to  0 the present configuration is accepted and the configuration is changed by flipping the spin at position $a_{12}$. 
This gives the new configuration $a_{11} = 1$, $a_{12} = 1$, $a_21 = 1$, $a_{22} = 1$. 
The change in energy due to switch of spin is found to be equal to -8, which is the expected value and change in magnetization which is calculated as magnetization before spin flip +2 * the selected spin value and  is equal to -2 which is also the expected value.
