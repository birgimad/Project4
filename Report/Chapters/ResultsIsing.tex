\section{Ising model}
Testing the number of Monte Carlo cycle needed for an acceptable result as seen in \tabref{tab:MCising} (Results are just written down directly from print out in the terminal window)

The results shows a good corrolation between the closed form soulution found earlier in \tabref{tab:ClosedFormSolution2times2T1} and the numerical result using MC methods in \tabref{tab:MCising}. 

For the energy the accuracy is to three digits when using 100000 MC cycles. And also the magnetization, specific heat and susceptibility shows acceptable results with one percent or less deviation from the closed form.
