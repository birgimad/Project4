\section{Solving the Integral by the Gauss-Legendre Method}
\label{sec:ResultsGaussLegendreMethod}
When solving the integral in \matref{eq:GLdMethod1} by Gauss-Legendre quadrature presented in \secref{sec:GaussLegendreMethod} with the limits from $-4$ to $4$, $\alpha = 2$, and number of mesh points $n=40$, the value of the integral becomes
\begin{align}
	GLd = 0.177118
\end{align}
The closed-form solution to the integral with infinite limits, is given in \secref{sec:NatureOfTheProblem}, and has a value of $5\pi^2 /16^2$.
The percentage deviation between the computed estimation of the integral value and the closed-form solution, is then
\begin{align}
	\text{percentage deviation} = \frac{0.177118 - 5\pi^2 /16^2}{5\pi^2 /16^2} \cdot 100 \% \approx -8.1 \%
\end{align}


This deviation is quite large, and since it is difficult to run with a higher number of mesh points, it shows that this method is quite inaccurate.
